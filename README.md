“Portfolio repo for CS 230 Software Design Project (The Gaming Room)”
Module Eight Journal Reflection

The client was The Gaming Room. They wanted to take their game Draw It or Lose It and make it work on different platforms, not just mobile. The software needed to support more than one team at a time, keep team and game names unique, and only allow one game running at once.

I think I did well explaining the requirements clearly and showing how design patterns like Singleton and Iterator fit the project. Writing the design document helped me stay organized and plan things out before thinking about code.

If I could change one part, I would add more detail about the operating systems. I made sure to focus on what the users needed, since that’s the most important part of making software useful. In the future, I’d use the same approach of planning first and using design patterns to guide my design.
