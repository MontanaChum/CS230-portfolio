“Portfolio repo for CS 230 Software Design Project (The Gaming Room)”
Module Eight Journal Reflection

The Gaming Room was my client, and they wanted me to design software for their game Draw It or Lose It. The software needed to support multiple teams with more than one player each, enforce unique names for games and teams, and make sure only one active game instance could run at a time. They also wanted the system to scale across different platforms and remain stable.

One thing I did well in the documentation was clearly explaining the requirements and using design patterns like Singleton and Iterator. These patterns made the design easy to follow and directly tied to the client’s needs.

Working through the design document was helpful because it gave me a plan before jumping into code. Writing out the requirements and constraints helped me understand what the client wanted and how the pieces of the system would fit together.

If I could revise one part, I would improve the recommendations section by adding more detail about the pros and cons of different operating platforms. This would make the document more complete and show stronger comparisons.

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on stability, scalability, and user experience. For example, keeping names unique and allowing only one active game instance matched what the client asked for. Considering user needs is important because the design has to solve their problems, not just work in theory.

My approach to designing software was to break the project into smaller parts and build around the requirements. In the future, I would continue using this strategy along with diagrams and step-by-step planning because it keeps the design process organized and clear.
